### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of my major learning in this project was trying out the mobile-first workflow approach and i must admit it was a great first experience for me. I also just find out about the picture tag which absolutely comes in handy for this product-preview-page project!

```
<h1>HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<picture>
  <source
    srcset="
      ./img/image-product-desktop.jpg
    "
    media="(min-width: 768px)"
  />
</picture>
```

### Continued development

I admitted working with the mobile-first workflow was a great experience for me but i must admit it was not relatively easy as my approach has always been desktop first, so yeah going forward i want to continue to embrace mobile-first workflow as it helps speed web apps on mobile devices which is a great practice.
